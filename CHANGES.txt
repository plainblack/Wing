  <script src="/wing.angular.js"></script>

  myApp = angular.module('MyApp',['wing']);

  myApp.controller('MyCtrl', function($scope, $http, objectListManager) {
    $scope.users = new objectListManager(
        fetch_options : {
            _include_options: 1,
            _include_relationships: 1, // required
        },
        list_api : '/api/user',
        create_api : '/api/user',
        on_create : function(object, index) {
            wing.success(object.username + ' created.');
        },
        on_update : function(object, index) {
            wing.success(object.username + ' saved.');
        },
        on_delete : function(object, index) {
            wing.success('Deleted' + object.name +'.');
        },
    });
  });

  <!-- in html -->
  <div ng-controller="MyCtrl">
    <div ng-repeat="user in users.objects">{{user.properties.username}} <button ng-click="user.delete()">Delete</button></div>
  </div>


2015-03-12
 * Fixed a bug where 0 didn't count as a defined value for required fields.

 * Did a lot of cleanup of the default templates to more modern practices.
 * Rewrote the user manager app to use AngularJS instead of Handlebars
 * wing.js added wing.angular_http_injector() which you can use like this:

    $httpProvider.interceptors.push(wing.angular_http_interceptor);
  });

      default_resultset_class => '+Wing::DB::ResultSet',
  );

2014-09-20

2013-09-25
 * Daemonized wingman.pl. You now need the Daemon::Control perl module. You can also add a "wingman/pid_file_path" directive to your config file if you want to control where the pid is stored.
 * Added --watch-only as a command line flag to wingman.pl so that you can specify a tube to watch other than the default tube. This is useful when you have different servers that you wish to handle different tubes.

2013-09-21
 * Fixed a major security hole where it was possible to create new objects in some cases when you shouldn't be able to.

2013-09-03
 * Wing::Role::Result::Field now allows you to pass a code reference into the options parameter so you can dynamically generate field options.

2013-08-12
 * Wing tenant sites now need a new configuration entry tenants/app_dir to tell Wing where to find the APP_DIR for tenants.  This allows the owner codebase to find it for doing database installs and library path handling.

2013-05-19

	to this added to their config files if they want to start
	using Wingman services.

    "wingman" : {
        "max_workers" : 2,
        "beanstalkd" : {
           "server" : "127.0.0.1",
           "ttr" : 60,
           "default_tube" : "wingman",
        },

                "phase" : "SendTemplatedEmail",
           },
           "Wingman::Plugin::EmailAllAdmins" : {
                "phase" : "EmailAllAdmins",
