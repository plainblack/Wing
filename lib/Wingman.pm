=head1 NAME

Wingman - A jobs server for Wing.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 my $wingman = Wingman->new;

 # as a client
 my $job = $wingman->put($plugin_name, \%args, \%opts); # create a job
 my $job = $wingman->reserve($timeout);                    # fetch a job

 # as the jobs task master
 $wingman->run;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

When you're building web services or web sites you often need to do long running tasks as background processes to avoid connection timeouts, such as sending a bunch of emails or thumbnailing images. Wingman solves this problem. Wingman also forks multiple workers so that you can run jobs in parallel taking advantage of multi-core systems; You can even run multiple wingman server instances if one server isn't cutting it.

The Wingman task master's job is simply to keep enough workers running as defined by C<max_workers> in the config file.

Workers block on their connection to beanstalkd until they receive a job. They either complete the job or fail, either way they exit so a new worker is spawned. The workers die to ensure no memory leaks or other wierdness from plugin interactions. This is less efficient than keeping them around, but the benefits outweigh the expense.

Workers have until C<TTR> (Time To Run) to complete the job. They should be wary of this and request more time from beanstalkd if they need more time. They can do this by calling the C<touch> method on the job, which will reset the TTR to it's original value. Nothing will kill them at the end of TTR, however, beanstalkd will give out the job to a new worker at the end of TTR.

If there's a chance that a plugin could hang, then the plugin needs to deal with this. L<Spawn::Safe> is a good way to deal with it.

Also, plugins should be designed to expect failure. So if there is a portion of a job that should not be run more than once, that should be tracked externally in case the plugin fails partway through, or it loses communication with beanstalkd to tell it that the job completed.

Add a new job to the queue.

=over

A string matching the the C<phase> in the config file.

A hash reference that will be passed directly to the job's C<run> method.

A hash reference of queuing options.

=over

=item tube

The name of the tube you want to insert this job into. If not specified, it will be inserted into the tube specified as C<default_tube> in the config file.

=item priority

Priority to use to queue the job. Jobs with smaller priority values will be scheduled before jobs with larger priorities. The most urgent priority is 0. Defaults to the C<priority> set in the config file.

=item delay

An integer number of seconds to wait before putting the job in the ready queue. The job will be in the "delayed" state during this time. Defaults to the C<delay> set in the config file.

=item ttr

The "Time To Run". An integer number of seconds to allow a worker to run this job. This time is counted from the moment a worker reserves this job. If the worker does not delete, release, or bury the job within ttr seconds, the job will time out and the server will release the job. The minimum ttr is 1. If the client sends 0, the server will silently increase the ttr to 1. Defaults to the C<ttr> set in the config file.
